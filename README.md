# React Gallery

## Description

_Duration: 1 Week_

This is a full-stack CRUD gallery built with React which allows users to submit a photo url, title, and description. These submissions are stored in a postgreSQL database, and the client-side updates on page load and after button clicks to update the display of photos and titles on the DOM. Visitors can click an image to see a description, and use a button to "like" an image. Users can also delete any image and it will be removed from both the DOM and the database.
